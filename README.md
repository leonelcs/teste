## Backend Assessment  
  
# Application

We would like you to create a java based backend application using REST.
It should contain the following endpoints;

  * GET /api/interest-rates (get a list of current interest rates)  
  * POST /api/mortgage-check (post the parameters to calculate for a mortgage check)
  
The list of current mortgage rates should be created in memory on application startup.
The mortgage rate object contains the fields; maturityPeriod (integer), interestRate (Percentage) and lastUpdate (Timestamp)
The posted data for the mortgage check contains at least the fields; income (Amount), maturityPeriod (integer), loanValue (Amount), homeValue (Amount).
The mortgage check return if the mortgage is feasible (boolean) and the montly costs (Amount) of the mortgage.

Business rules that apply are
- a mortgage should not exceed 4 times the income
- a mortgage should not exceed the home value

Use the frameworks as you see fit to build and test this. 

**NOTE**: Please do not use a generator (like yeoman),
because then it is very difficult for us to determine what you have written yourself and what parts are generated.

# Implementation  
Treat this application as a real MVP that should go to production.
  
# Merge request  
Provide us with a merge request to master of this repository.

# Duration
This assignment should take 4-5 hours at the most.

Good luck!
